    <p class="para"><b style="font-size:18px;">Chitwan National Park</b> is one of the best tour site in Nepal.
    It covers all the highlighted activities such as Village tours, Tharu Culture Dance to Elephant Safari,
    Canoe ride, Jungle Walk and many more. Chitwan is acessible from Kathmandu, Pokahra or from Lumbini.
    It is about 5 hours drive from Kathmandu and Pokhara whereas flight is just 25 minutes.
    </p>

    <p class="para">For a country known for its beautiful mountains, the Gangetic flat lands of the Terai that stretches through
    our Rhinot the southern part of Nepal provide a wholly different experience. A visit to Nepal remains incomplete
    without seeing the beauty of the Terai and Chitwan is the best place to do so. The Chitwan National Park,
    established in 1973, provides a great wildlife experience with its rich flora and fauna. The wildlife and the
    landscape are not as breathtaking as those found in Africa but still, the experience will stand out.Chitwan is
    only 150m above the sea level. The place gets steamy from March-June, with peak temperatures reaching 43°C in the
    shade. Short grass makes Feb-May the best game-viewing season, but the autumn months are gorgeous, with Himalayan
    views, and in winter (December-January), Chitwan is pleasantly warmed compared to Kathmandu.</p>
